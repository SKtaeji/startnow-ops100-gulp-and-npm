This is the project for Gulp and npm.

If you want to load this in terminal, use 'cd' to wherever you have 
the files on your hard drive.

Then, install gulp using 'npm install -g gulp'.

Next, run 'build:js' and 'build:css', as you'll need to build these files from scratch.

Finally, run 'gulp' to build the webpage.
